    "\n",
    "There are 4 steps in Data-Driven Decision Making\n",
    " - Formulate a hypothesis\n",
    " - Find the right test for the hypothesis\n",
    " - Execute the test \n",
    " - Make a decision based on the result\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis:\n",
    "It is an idea that can be tested. When there is no data to be tested, it is not a hypotesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis\n",
    " - Denoted as H0 => \n",
    " - the one to be tested\n",
    " - The concept is \"innocent until proven guilty\"\n",
    " - it is the statement we try to reject\n",
    " - it is the status quo or the present state of affairs.\n",
    " \n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis:\n",
    " - Denoted as H1 or HA.\n",
    " - it everything else the null hyp is not\n",
    " - it is the change or innovation that challenges the status quo\n",
    " - it is our personal opinion\n",
    " \n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hyp: Mean data scientist salary equals 113,000 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hyp = Mean data scientist salary is not equal to 113,000 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if the 113,000 is close enough to the true mean predicted by our sample\n",
    "\n",
    "Accept if: Sample is close enough to the true mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Reject if: Sample is too far from the true mean\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a two-sided test\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean data scientists salary is more than 125,000 dollars\n",
